    Implements standard early stopping based on validation loss.

    Stops training when the validation loss has not improved by at least
    a relative threshold for a given number of 'patience' epochs.

    Args:
        patience (int): How many epochs to wait after last time validation loss
                        improved significantly. Default: 5.
        threshold (float): Minimum relative improvement required to consider
                           the loss as having improved. Should be positive.
                           e.g., 0.01 means a 1% decrease is needed. Default: 0.01.
